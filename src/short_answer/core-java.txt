What is a JDK composed of? Define each components?
Answer: Java Development Kit(JDK) composed of JVM, JRE, Development Tools build in.
    JVM:  Provide runtime environment in which Java byte code can be executed. JVM loads code, verifies code, executes code,
       provide runtime environment. JVM does not exist physically.
    JRE: is composed of Java Virtual Machine and set of libraries that JVM uses at runtime. Together it called JRE.
        JRE physically exists in the computer.
    Development Tools: Consist of Debugger, Compiler, JVaDoc etc.

What is a class?
Answer: Class is a blueprint or building block. Class can be called a logical template to create the objects that share
    common properties and methods. Class consist of Access Modifiers, class keyword, Class name(1st letter capital),
    Constructor, Body with in "{}".

What is an object?

What is the entry point of a Java project?
Answer: The entry point is the Main method of the class.

Why is the main() method static?
Answer: It is because in order to run the application the compiler needs to call the main method. And without creating a
    object of the class, to call the main method we leave it as static.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
Answer: The path variable contains the path to the java executables such as the compiler. The class path contains the path to the

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Answer: A class can implement multiple Interface and A class can inherit only one Abstract Class.
    In an abstract interface keyword, is optional for declaring a method as an abstract. Abstract keyword is a must for declaring a
    method as an abstract.
    An interface can have only public abstract methods. An abstract class has protected and public abstract methods.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class? If yes or no, how would you do it?
Answer:

What is Access Modifier?
Answer: It determines where a method or variable can be accessed from. It can be public, private, protected and default.
    Public -- It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package and outside the package.
    Private -- It can only be access from in side the class, it can't be accessed from outside the class or method.
    Protected -- It can access from within and outside the class, and only with in the package. But if you create a child class then outside the package.
    Default -- It can access from within the class and only within the package can't access from outside. If you don't specify and access level it will be default.

What is OOP? Define each OOP concept.
Answer: Object-Oriented Programing is a programing language based on the concepts of objects and classes. The core concept
of the object-oriented approach is to brake complex problems into smaller objects.
    Abstraction: A class can hide the implementation of its objects from the user and only provide the functionality.
    Polymorphism: The idea that the same method can behave in different ways. It can be by method overloading or method overriding.
    Inheritance: A class can inheritance the elements (states and behaviors) of another class.
    Encapsulation: The idea of wrapping code in a single unit (data hiding). After the data is hid from the user, it can be accessed through getter and setter methods.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
Answer: In java package is collection of classes. The core java library is imported by default, and it is included in the JDK.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle them.
Answer: An exception is a run-time error. It occurs at runtime if there is an error. We can handle exceptions by putting the code into a try/catch code block
         and wrapping the code inside that will give exception. We must specify the type of exception that the program will encounter in the catch.

What is static keyword? When and how do we use it?
Answer: meaning only one copy of the method or variable will be available and static method or variable can be access without creating an instance of the class.
    Static can be used to refer to the common property of all abjects (which is not unique for each object).

What is final keyword? When and how do we use it?
Answer: Final makes a variable value constant (unchangeable).
    It used for stop value change, stop method overloading, stop Inheritance.

Explain the difference between final, finally and finalize?
Answer: Final is a keyword to make a variable final.
         Finally is a keyword used at the end of a try/catch block to execute another block code no matter what happens (even if the program runs into an exception). If it runs into
         an exception, the codeblock inside finally will be executed before the program crashes.
         Finalize is a method that belongs to the Object class and it is called before an object is sent to garbage collection or (destroyed).

What is a constructor?
Answer: is when an instance of a class is created. Every class has a default constructor except abstract class.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
Answer: No, It will always be the same constructor same as the class name. We can overload the constructor.

Answer: It will call the default constructor.
